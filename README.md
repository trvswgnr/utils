# utils

this monorepo is a collection of utils that i find useful, fun, or interesting.

as a Roll Your Own Everything enthusiast, most things will be written from
scratch with no external dependencies. that said, you should probably not use
most of these and should instead roll your own.

they are separated in folders by language, and then by package/library/module/etc...
